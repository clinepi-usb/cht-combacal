# created by running following cmd in medic os container:
# find . -printf 'chown -h %U:%G %h/%f\n' > restore-original-ownerships.sh
# use -h option to change the ownership of the symlink and not of the linked file (the latter is default behaviour)
# the linked file is changed anyway as we run an ownership change on each file
# the script can be used to restore all needed permissions on the directories
# as copying the data to container as transport vehicle for the bootstrapped CHT
# App resets all ownership's to root (UID:0) when copying the files into the container.
# Permissions are not changed.
